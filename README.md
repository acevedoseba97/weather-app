<h1 align="center">Responsive Weather App</h1>
This is my second project using frontend tech. This project makes AJAX calls to WeatherAPI to get access to different regions.

<mark>IMPORTANT</mark>: For this project to properly work, you need to register in <a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/" target="_blank">WeatherAPI</a> and get an API Key. Once you get the key, place it in the script.js file in the APIKey variable.

## About
This is a weather app that displays weather information from any place:
* The background of the application changes to suit the weather displayed in the city/region.
* It has day/night time difference.
* It is responsive, it works on any device.
