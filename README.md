<h1 align="center">Responsive Weather App</h1>
This is my second project using frontend tech. This project makes AJAX calls to WeatherAPI to get weather data from different regions.

<mark>**IMPORTANT**</mark>: For this project to properly work, you need to register in <a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/" target="_blank">WeatherAPI</a> and get an API Key. Once you get the key, place it in the <img alt="Static Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/script.js-%23ff0"> file in the _APIKey_ variable.

## About
This is a weather app that displays weather information from any place:
* The background of the application changes to suit the weather displayed in the city/region.
* It has day/night time difference.
* It is responsive, it works on any device.
