<h1 align="center">Responsive Weather App</h1>
This is my second project using frontend tech. This project has AJAX calls to WeatherAPI to get access to different regions.

## About
This is a weather app that displays weather information from any place:
* The background of the application changes to suit the weather displayed in the city/region.
* It has day/night time difference.
* It is responsive, it works on any device.
